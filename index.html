<p>Oh My God - (G)I-DLE</p>
Nothing can pull me away
From your embrace
I’m not going anywhere
Here we go again
I hear the sound of pain
Flowing slowly through my veins
 
Help me help me
Oh I don’t know how to breathe for real
Set me free set me free
This craving is gonna be deadly
 
I know that you’re only playin’
I hate it so much I love it
What would be the repercussions
If I let you inside me
It’s so dangerous I want it
Guess you got me where you want me
I don’t care that I’m addicteds
 
Oh my god She took me to the skys
Oh my god She showed me all the stars
 
Babe babe
You got me losing my mind tonight
Toxic toxic
I tell my friends that I’m fine it’s a lie
 
Oh god
I should stay away
But then you will hit me up
And I am on my way
Can’t stop
Girl you make me sick
But then you make me
wanna stick around
I know I got it bad it feels good
Yeah I’ll regret it
You’re detrimental to my health
But I ain’t never leavin’
I’m probably crazy
But I need it want it gotta have it
You may be poison
But sure as hell taste like honey
 
Losing all my senses when you
Pull me close I don’t know how to
Let go of this passion
So just burn me with your loving
I can’t control this desire
We get close the flames get higher
Nothing can put out this fire
 
Oh my god She took me to the sky
Oh my god She showed me all the stars
 
Put your hands all over
Want your smell on me forever
I’m losing my composure
Can’t nobody do me better
Time and time again
I told myself I need to let go
Then I fall right back into your arms
 
Oh my god She took me to the sky
Oh my god She showed me all the stars
 
Nothing can pull me away
From your embrace
I’m not going anywhere
Here we go again
I hear the sound of pain
Flowing slowly through my veins
